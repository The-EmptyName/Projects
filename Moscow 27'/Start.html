        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>The following website/game is a parody of a SNES game "Hong Kong 97" and may contain vulgar language and gore (kinda).<br/>
            <h4>NOTE:</h4><br/>
            1. Player's dead was not implemented becouse <s>I'm too lazy</s> it's a feature.<br/>
            2. You can't win the game.</br>
            3. The longer you play, the glitchier it gets. Probably too many intervals and timeouts at the same time. idk or neither I care<br/>
            4. Game's characters' resemblence to real people is just a coincedence.<br/>
            5. Make sure to play on PC and on Google Chrome. Also turn your music on.<br/>
